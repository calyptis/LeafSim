# LeafSim

An example-based explanaible AI (XAI) technique to explain decision tree based ensemble methods.
The technique uses the Hamming distance of leaf indices to measure similarity between a given test and all training instances. It therefore explains a model by identifying training data points that most influenced a given prediction.
